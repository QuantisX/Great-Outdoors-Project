It allows individuals to park at and use a variety of state parks, wildlife areas, and recreation lands. These lands are managed by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Department of Natural Resources.</span>
        </p>
        
        <p class="c0">
            <span class="c1">The Discover Pass is required for most state recreation areas, including parks, trailheads, and some boat launches, and it helps support the maintenance and operation of these areas. There are a couple of options available:</span>
        </p>
        
        <ul class="c9 lst-kix_fihuqstwmtsi-0 start">
            <li class="c0 c3 li-bullet-0">
                <span class="c4">Annual Discover Pass</span><span class="c1">: Provides unlimited access to state parks and other recreation lands for a full year from the purchase date.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="c0 c3 li-bullet-0">
                <span class="c4">One-Day Discover Pass</span><span class="c1">: Allows access for a single day.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="c0"><span>The pass can be purchased online, at participating retail locations, or through
             a kiosk in some parks. Some locations also offer a </span><span class="c4">two-day pass</span>
             <span class="c1">, and a portion of the revenue supports park and land maintenance. It&#39;s a 
             great way to support the preservation of Washington&#39;s natural resources and enjoy the outdoors!</span>

        <p class="c0"><span>A </span><span class="c4">Northwest Forest Pass</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is a
             recreational pass that provides access to national forests and recreation areas in the Pacific
             Northwest of the United States. This pass is typically required for visitors who plan to park 
             at specific recreation sites, like trailheads, campgrounds, or day-use areas in national forests.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It covers areas in states such as Washington and Oregon and is used to
             support the upkeep of these recreation areas. The pass is available for purchase as an annual or 
             daily pass, depending on the needs of the visitor.</span>

        <p class="c8"><span class="c1">A backcountry pass refers to a permit or access pass required to use certain
             backcountry areas for outdoor recreation, such as hiking, skiing, snowboarding, or snowshoeing. 
             These passes are often needed in areas that are not served by traditional ski lifts or other infrastructure 
             but are popular for wilderness experiences, including National Forests, wilderness areas, and certain ski areas.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are different types of backcountry passes, including:</span></p>

        <ol class="c9 lst-kix_ofo9tdons7u0-0 start" start="1">
            <li class="c0 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Sno-Park Permits</span><span class="c1">: These are needed for winter recreation in designated Sno-Park areas. They are required for activities like cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, and snowshoeing. These permits are typically issued by the Washington State Parks and can be used in the winter months, from November to March.</span></li>
            <li class="c0 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Backcountry Ski Passes</span><span class="c1">: Some backcountry areas, especially ski areas that offer off-piste or uphill skiing access, may require a specific pass or permit. For example, certain resorts or backcountry zones might require you to buy a pass to access the area.</span></li>
            <li class="c0 c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4">Wilderness Area Permits</span><span class="c1">: These are required for accessing specific wilderness areas, especially if you&#39;re planning an overnight stay or heading into more remote parts of the state. Permits are generally available through the U.S. Forest Service or the National Park Service.</span></li>
        </ol>

        
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each type of pass typically helps fund trail maintenance, education programs, and environmental protection efforts in the backcountry. It&#39;s important to check the specific area you plan to visit for any required passes or permits.</span></p>
