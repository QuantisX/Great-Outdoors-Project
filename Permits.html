Some wilderness trails, state parks, and camps do require permits or passes. This is done to help manage visitor numbers and protect natural resources. These permits can vary greatly based on how long you want to visit and the location of the trail. There are also areas that require advanced reservations or are first come first-serve, (i.e Mount Rainier National Park, Olympic Cascades National park, etc). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of resources that can help you determine what/which passes/permits you need.
Discover Pass 
Discover Pass | Washington State Parks
A Washington State Discover Pass is a permit that grants access to state-managed recreation lands in Washington. It allows individuals to park at and use a variety of state parks, wildlife areas, and recreation lands. These lands are managed by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Department of Natural Resources.
The Discover Pass is required for most state recreation areas, including parks, trailheads, and some boat launches, and it helps support the maintenance and operation of these areas. There are a couple of options available:
Annual Discover Pass: Provides unlimited access to state parks and other recreation lands for a full year from the purchase date.
One-Day Discover Pass: Allows access for a single day.
The pass can be purchased online, at participating retail locations, or through a kiosk in some parks. Some locations also offer a two-day pass, and a portion of the revenue supports park and land maintenance. It's a great way to support the preservation of Washington's natural resources and enjoy the outdoors!
